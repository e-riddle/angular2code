      "body": "<p>Xamarin allows C# and F# developers to target multiple platforms with the language and tools they love. Whether you're looking to build cross-platform mobile applications targeting iOS and Android or if you are hoping to build the next great Mac application, Xamain has you covered. In this session, I'll briefly cover where Xamarin came from (believe it or not it has been around since 2009!) and where it's heading before launching into a tour of its features and workflows. I'll show you how to use Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio to build iOS and Android applications. We'll take a look at Xamarin.Forms which helps you build cross-platform apps with a shared UI codebase. We'll also take a look at connected/disconnected apps that use Azure. You'll leave with enough knowledge to decide for yourself (or convince your boss!) that Xamarin is right for your project.</p>",

However, to have a constant flow of value, organizations must shift their notions of deployments from an overly bureaucratic manual process to an automated process with little human intervention.  How can release managers have faith in an automated process that removes much of the manual overhead of traditional release flows?</p><p>This session will cover the tools available in VSTS and Azure that allows organizations to release continuously with confidence.  We will cover how automated testing can be used for builds and release pipelines, how environments can be auto-generated or refreshed to a known state automatically and how applications can be monitored using features built into Azure.  And in case you are wondering, what is DevOps and how does it fit into the whole application lifecycle.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Data today is more decentralized than ever. Businesses store critical organizational data across a wide array of disparate systems. With the average company running upwards of 20+ SaaS applications, and at least as many on-premises databases and internal apps, it's impossible to build, manage, and maintain connectivity with each. So, how do you solve the data connectivity problem? The Answer: Data Abstraction. By leveraging common standards-based data interfaces like ADO.NET, ODBC, and OData, you can eliminate need for custom integration and its associated expense.</p><p>Learn about the benefits of using standards-based interfaces to access your data, no matter where it is. Do you have data in Salesforce.com? Are you also using QuickBooks? And HubSpot? And you have data stored in a MongoDB database? Use a standards-based data abstraction layer to connect, combine, pipeline, and transform data, regardless of original API or data source.</p><p>In this talk we'll explore a sample company's data, expose the vast number of integrations required to work with that data, and see the benefits of using common interfaces like ADO.NET, and OData for standardizing data access between sources.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Are you tired of manual installs and updates? Have you run into problems caused by incompatible libraries? Do you need to notify your colleagues for every single new release of your library? If the answer is YES, then consider about package managers. A package manager is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner. A package manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files. Packages contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. This session will give you a brief overview of some common used package managers.</p>\n",

Caching application assets and data can be complex, especially for larger applications. What to cache, how long to cache and how to cache are all valid questions. Often, in an effort to just ship something, we cache nothing. When we don't cache, we disappoint the customer and miss a key promise of progressive web applications.</p>\n<p>In this session we will cover real details about caching reality based on real world experience in bringing Progressive Web Applications to market. This is not a session to sell the concept, but a session to highlight caching nuances you don't see until you sit down to write the code.</p>\n<p>Sure the Chrome engineers know the node modules, sw-precache &#038; sw-toolbox, they developed. But what happens when you, the general developer uses them? How do you use the sw-precache and sw-toolbox modules to craft a caching strategy for your application? How do you even determine what to cache? How can you get yourself in trouble? And more importantly, how can you get out of trouble and prevent hours or days of frustration?</p>\n",

This way of development has to do with the following question and its answer: Question - How do you debug data you don't understand yet? The answer that I discovered combines some data analysis with the heart of an explorer and some outside-of-the-box debugging techniques as you develop, and essentially tries to implement a form of data code coverage so that we can relatively quickly trace through every unique combination of data types. And, yes, we will definitely look at some code, both C# and T-SQL. This methodology should be useful in any language, and will be more applicable the more complicated the data is. Also, this is not for just SQL or C#, but for any development platform having a decent debugger. Finally, this methodology can assist in catching those elusive intermittent bugs.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Do you want to build web sites that can compete with the best native apps?<br />\nYou may have an old web site that needs remodeling to give it new life, but you don't know how to start or if the web is even capable.<br />\nPerhaps you're wondering how to make your web site work offline and instantly load under any condition.<br />\nMaybe you want to get your apps in the Windows Store or gain access to Windows platform APIs.<br />\nWould you like to build a web site that your users want to add to their home screens and even get native push notifications?<br />\nYou have heard of service workers but don't know what they are or how to use them???</p>\n<p>You may be asking yourself all these questions or being asked by your clients and stakeholders. You want or need answers and how to execute them. You might even want to learn the latest best practices for building web sites. This is what Progressive Web Applications and service workers offer the modern web developer. Today's web is on par with native applications, yet most developers remain naive about new APIs and user experience features.</p>\n<p>This workshop is a structured introduction to the benefits of progressive web applications and how to build web applications that leverage the latest web technologies to create 'user experience magic.' Progressive web applications generously let you unobtrusively upgrade existing sites without a massive resource investment.</p>\n<p>Chris Love will guide you through a successful progressive web application project. After discussing the benefits of progressive web apps, along with selling points for your stubborn boss, you will dive into the technical details. You will learn how to implement the three key requirements of PWA: HTTPS, Web Manifest and a Service Worker. Then you will get intimate with the Fetch and Service Worker Cache APIs. You will also learn how to implement native push notifications, just like a native application.</p>\n<p>But wait, there is more!</p>\n<p>The workshop also covers how to build a reference e-commerce progressive web application - where you learn how to apply the concepts to your own work or personal web sites. In addition, you'll gain insight how to account for older browsers and platforms that have not yet implemented full support of progressive web applications.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, you will have a firm foundation in the exciting world of progressive web applications and how they can enhance your business, engage your customers, increase work satisfaction, and improve your productivity.</p>\n<p>As a bonus attendees will receive full access to my upcoming online progressive web application course. This includes videos, slide decks, source code and workbook plus any future content refreshes. So your training will not end when the day is over.</p>",

      "body": "<p>To create excellent software, you need to know a lot more than just the language basics. If you are an experienced developer looking to take things to the next level, this talk is for you. In this talk I'll present many patterns and practices that I use as a Technical Architect. I'll review and demonstrate many of my favorite patterns such as SOLID, Repository Pattern, Unit Of Work, Dependency Injection, etc. I'll show how these patterns can be used for both server and client side development in ASP.NET MVC. I'll demonstrate great ways to use TFS for automating your builds and deployments. During this full day session I will create a web application using VS2015, C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, SQL Server, Bootstrap, Knockout.js and ELMAH. Unlike in traditional short talks, with the full day session you'll see how all the pieces fit together. As always, I'll throw in lots of tips and tricks along the way. FYI: this is a repeat (with some updates) from my popular full day session from the last Philly Code Camp. The session will not be hands-on for attendees however I'll provide the complete solution with which you can review and experiment.</p>",

The syntax changes are considerable but make sense given new directions in modern web development. We start with a quick overview of Angular 1 and slowly migrate an application to Angular 2. Along the way we learn how W3C components are the modern building blocks that package templates, inputs, outputs, controller code, and even styles in reusable packages. We dive into reactive programming to see how RxJS and Observables expand on legacy JavaScript promises. We test some commercial components built on this foundation using Angular Material, grids, and charts to give the application a finished look. </p>\n<p>This lab is completely hands-on with data and frameworks provided on a USB drive. Demonstrations will use Visual Studio Code and TypeScript with Snippets and Angular CLI with NodeJS.</p>",
